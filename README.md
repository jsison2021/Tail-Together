### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Social Networking
- **Mobile:** This app will be started with mobile with the possibility of expanding to web base for computers
- **Story:** Allows a user to make an event from small as a party to a concert or football games. Then other users can say they are going then may chat about the event for rideshare, outfit coordination, or tips/hacks

- **Habit:** A individual can use this app as much as they want to meet new friends before the venue
